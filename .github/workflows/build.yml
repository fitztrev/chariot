      # We create jar files, which use the zip format - which contains timestamps
      # :facepalm: I.e the generated data will differ depending on when it is built.
      # In order to get a "Reproducable Build", we will use a tool to fix the jars,
      # after they have been created.
      # The tool is called "strip-nondeterminism" and can be used to set a specific
      # timestamp (instead of "now".)
      # We'll use the timestamp of the commit we are about to release.
      # (In addition to the timestamp, I think the order of the files in the jar files
      # can be random too - but also this will be taken care of by "strip-nondeterminism")
